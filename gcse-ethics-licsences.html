                    <p>When you use a piece of software, you don't usually own the software itself. Instead, you are granted permission to use it under certain terms and conditions. This permission is given through a <strong class="keyword">software license<span class="tooltip">A legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. It grants the user permission to use the software under specified conditions.</span></strong>.</p>
                    <p>A software license is a legal agreement between the software creator (or copyright holder) and the user. It defines what the user can and cannot do with the software, such as how many computers it can be installed on, whether it can be modified, and if it can be shared with others.</p>
                    <p>Licenses are crucial because software is a form of <span class="keyword">intellectual property (IP)<span class="tooltip">Creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.

The license ensures that creators get paid or acknowledged for their work and helps prevent unauthorized use or distribution.</p>
                    <p>There are two main categories of software licenses: <strong class="keyword">Open Source<span class="tooltip">Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

                    <p>When an organization chooses software, they must consider several legal aspects:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 text-sm">
                        <li><strong>Abiding by the Software License:</strong> This is paramount. The license dictates how many users can use it, if it can be copied, modified, etc. Ignoring the license is a breach of contract and often copyright law.</li>
                        <li><strong>Open Source Implications:</strong> If choosing open source software, the organization must understand the specific open source license terms.
                            <ul>
                                <li>They can usually make modifications.</li>
                                <li>However, some licenses (e.g., "copyleft" licenses like GPL) require that any modifications or derivative works are also made open source under the same terms.</li>
                                <li>They must usually credit all previous contributors if redistributing modified code.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cost of Proprietary Software:</strong> Purchasing licenses for off-the-shelf proprietary software can be expensive, especially for many users. This needs to be budgeted for.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Protection Compliance:</strong> Any software that handles <span class="keyword">personal data<span class="tooltip">Information relating to an identifiable living individual. Examples include name, address, email, medical records, online identifiers.</span></span> must enable the organization to comply with the <span class="keyword">Data Protection Act (DPA)<span class="tooltip">UK law governing the processing of personal data.
